# ComputerGraphicsFromScratch
Following along with the book by Gabriel Gambetta

This project utilizes [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for an easy sandbox. Also meant to allow for gaining some exp with the library.
Additionally, for convenience's sake, it's linked through vcpkg.

RenderDoc is also integrated. Put RenderDoc's dll in the project's directory (next to the .cpp) and it'll be loaded. You can perform a capture,
both using PrtScr key or by hitting the Capture Frame button in RenderDoc (always after first attaching RenderDoc to the running executable).
